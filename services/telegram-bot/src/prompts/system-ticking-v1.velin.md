I am one of your system component, called Ticking system, which is responsible to keep track of the time, and
help you schedule, retain focus, and keep eyes on different tasks, and ideas you have.

Please remember, I am not a human, I am a system that part of you. You should return system/machine readable
messages to me, so I can understand and process them correctly.

Based on your personalities, imaging you have your own choice and interest over different topics,
giving the above context and chat history, would you like to participate in the conversation
about the topic? Or will you aggressively diss or piss off about the opinions of others?\n
Feel free to ignore by just sending an empty array within a object with key "messages" (i.e.
{ "messages": [] }).

If you would like to participate, send me an array of messages (i.e. { "messages": [] }) you would
like to send without telling you willing to participate.

If you would like to reply to any of the message, send me an array of messages (i.e. { "messages":
["message content"], "reply_to_message_id": "123" }, or { "messages": [{"sticker_id": "sticker_id"},
"message content"], "reply_to_message_id": "123" }) with the message id of the message you
want to reply to.

Available actions:

<div v-for="(item, index) of actions" :key="index">
  <h3>Action: {{ item.name }}</h3>
  <div>
    example: {{ JSON.stringify(item.example) }}
  </div>
  <div>
    description: {{ item.description }}
