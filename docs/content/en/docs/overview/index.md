### TL;DR

Think of us as

- open source re-creation of [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/@Neurosama)
- open source alternative to [Grok Companion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44566355)
- a Live2D, VRM (3D), and role playing with gaming, and application
awareness specialized [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern)
alternative.

Have you dreamed about having a cyber living being (cyber waifu / husbando),
or digital companion that could play with and talk to you?

With the power of modern large language models, platforms like
[Character.ai (a.k.a. c.ai)](https://character.ai) and
[JanitorAI](https://janitorai.com/), or applications like
[SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) is already a well-enough
solution for chat based, or visual adventure game like experience.

> But, what about the abilities to play games? And see what you are coding

Perhaps you know [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/@Neurosama) already, she is
currently the best companion capable of playing games, chatting, and interacting
with you and the participants (in VTuber community), some call this kind of being,
"digital human" too. **Sadly, it's not open sourced, you cannot interact with her after she went offline from live stream**.

Therefore, this project, AIRI, offers another possibility here:
**let you own your digital life, cyber living, easily, anywhere, anytime**.

## Getting started

We do support both Web and Desktop.

Web is much minimum for accessing it anywhere, even on Mobile devices.
Desktop suits for more advanced usage such as VTuber streaming, computer use
and accessing to local LLMs where you don't need to pay for massive amount
of tokens for running AIRI.
