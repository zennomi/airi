# Dejavu

For the past few weeks, the major quests of Project AIRI itself
haven't progressed for a while, perhaps I was quite burned
out from the huge UI refactoring and release since March
2025. Most of the work was done by community maintainers,

Most profoundly appreciated to [@LemonNekoGH](https://github.com/LemonNekoGH) and
[@RainbowBird](https://github.com/luoling8192),
[@LittleSound](https://github.com/LittleSound) for their work done in the field of

- Character Card support

::: tip What is Character Card?
Well, local-first chat applications like [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern)
, [RisuAI](https://risuai.net/) or online services like [JanitorAI](https://janitorai.com/) uses、 a
file contains character's background, personality, and other role-playing essential context for
each individual characters.

- https://realm.risuai.net/
- https://aicharactercards.com/
- https://chub.ai/

Character cards aren't the only thing for storing sharing LLM driven role-playing
characters, [Lorebook](https://docs.novelai.net/text/lorebook.html) plays another key role
in this field, but this is totally another story worth to write a entire series of
documentation to share, for now, try read [Void's Lorebook Types](https://rentry.co/lorebooks-and-you) and
[AI Dynamic Storytelling Wiki](https://aids.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).

> I personally love this wiki for learning these concepts:
> [AI Dynamic Storytelling Wiki](https://aids.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page),
> worth reading if you are interested in AI role-playing.
:::

> To use Character Card, navigate to Settings page (top right
> corner of the app, or hovering Gear icon in desktop app),
> Find and click the "Airi Card" button.

For Character Card showcases, we tried some approaches too...

<img class="dark" :src="CharacterCardShowcaseDark" alt="a card like user interface design for a blue hair character called ReLU" />

It's live in our UI component library, you can play around with it: https://airi.moeru.ai/ui/#/story/src-components-menu-charactercard-story-vue .

> Pure CSS and JavaScript controlled, layout works so we don't need to worry about the canvas calculation.

> much appreciated.

- Tauri MCP support
- Connects AIRI to Android devices

These two was major update and try-out, and this part was done by [@LemonNekoGH](https://github.com/LemonNekoGH),
she wrote another two DevLogs about these things and shared the technical
details behind the scene. (Valuable for Tauri developers and users I guess.)
You can read them here:

## Project AIRI major quests

### Ears listening, and mouth speaking

From April 15, I found both VAD (voice activation detection),
[ASR (a.k.a. automatic speech recognition)](https://huggingface.co/tasks/automatic-speech-recognition),
and [TTS (text to speech)](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-to-speech) in AIRI
are very complex and hard to use and understand, for that time, I was cooperating
with [@himself65](https://github.com/himself65) to improve and test the use cases
for the new project from [Llama Index](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), a library
to help to process the event based stream of LLM streaming tokens, and audio
bytes, called [`llama-flow`](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-flow).

[`llama-flow`](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-flow) is really small,
and type-safe to use. In the old days without it, I have to manually wrap
another **queue** structured, and Vue's reactivity powered workflow system
to chain many asynchronous tasks together to be able to process data to power AIRI.

That was the time I started to experiment more examples, demos on simplifying VAD,
ASR, TTS workflow.

Eventually, I got this:
[WebAI Realtime Voice Chat Examples](https://github.com/proj-airi/webai-example-realtime-voice-chat),
which I managed to proof the work can be done on Web browser within one single
300 ~ 500 lines of TypeScript code to achieve ChatGPT voice chat system.

<video controls muted style="{ height: '640px' }">
  <source src="./assets/webai-examples-demo.MP4"/>
</video>

I tried my best to split all the possible steps into small and reusable pieces
to help demonstrate how you can construct a real-time voice chat system
from ground up and scratch:

- [VAD](https://github.com/proj-airi/webai-example-realtime-voice-chat/tree/8462ff6bcb83bb278bce5388d588d2e3e3dd6dae/apps/vad)
- [VAD + ASR](https://github.com/proj-airi/webai-example-realtime-voice-chat/tree/8462ff6bcb83bb278bce5388d588d2e3e3dd6dae/apps/vad-asr)
- [VAD + ASR + LLM Chat](https://github.com/proj-airi/webai-example-realtime-voice-chat/tree/8462ff6bcb83bb278bce5388d588d2e3e3dd6dae/apps/vad-asr-chat)
- [VAD + ASR + LLM Chat + TTS](https://github.com/proj-airi/webai-example-realtime-voice-chat/tree/8462ff6bcb83bb278bce5388d588d2e3e3dd6dae/apps/vad-asr-chat-tts)

> Hope you could learn some from them.

During this time, we discovered a interesting and powerful repository though,
called [k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx), it supports
18 tasks of speech processing across macOS, Windows, Linux, Android,
iOS, etc. over 12 languages. Fascinating!

So [@luoling](https://github.com/luoling8192) made another small demo for this too:
[Sherpa ONNX powered VAD + ASR + LLM Chat + TTS](https://github.com/proj-airi/webai-example-realtime-voice-chat/tree/main/apps/sherpa-onnx-demo)

#### Birth of xsAI 🤗 Transformers.js

Because the work we have done for VAD, ASR, Chat, and TTS demos, this gave the
birth of a new side project called [xsAI 🤗 Transformers.js](https://github.com/proj-airi/xsai-transformers)
, enabling the simplicity to call the WebGPU powered model inference and serving with
workers while still keeping the API compatible to our prior succeeded project called
[xsAI](https://github.com/moeru-ai/xsai).

We got a playground for that too... play it on [https://xsai-transformers.netlify.app](https://xsai-transformers.netlify.app).

You can install it via npm today!

```bash
npm install xsai-transformers
```

::: tip What does this mean?
This means you can swap between cloud LLM and speech providers and local WebGPU
powered models with one if switch.

This brought us a new possibility to be able to experiment and even achieve
simple RAG and re-ranking system right in the browser, without the need of
any server side code, or even a backend server.

Oh, Node.js was supported, too!
:::

### Telegram Bot

I added the support of Telegram bot to be able to process animated stickers,
powered by `ffmpeg` (what else, obviously).
It now can read and understand the animated stickers and even videos sent
by users.

The system prompt was way too huge, I managed to reduce the size of the
system prompt drastically to save more than **80%** of the token usage.

### Character Card showcase

Many image assets requires me to manually find a suitable and easy to use
online solutions to remove backgrounds, but I decided to make my on based
on the work that [Xenova](https://github.com/xenova) have done... to make
one for my own.

I did some small experiments on integrating a WebGPU powered background
remover right in the system, you can play around with it here in
[https://airi.moeru.ai/devtools/background-remove](https://airi.moeru.ai/devtools/background-remove).

### xsAI & unSpeech

We added support for Alibaba Cloud Model Studio and Volcano Engine as speech
provider, quite useful I guess?

### UI

- New [Tutorial stepper](https://airi.moeru.ai/ui/#/story/src-components-misc-steppers-steppers-story-vue?variantId=src-components-misc-steppers-steppers-story-vue-0), [File upload](https://airi.moeru.ai/ui/#/story/src-components-form-input-inputfile-story-vue?variantId=default), and [Textarea](https://airi.moeru.ai/ui/#/story/src-components-form-textarea-textarea-story-vue?variantId=default) component
- Color issues
- [Typography improved](https://airi.moeru.ai/ui/#/story/stories-typographysans-story-vue?)

More of the stories can be found at [Roadmap v0.5](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi/issues/113)

## Side-quests

### [Velin](https://github.com/luoling8192/velin)

Since we got the Character Card supported, the feeling wasn't so good and
smooth when dealing with template variable rendering, and component reusing...

What if...

- We could maintain a component prompt library that can be used for other agent or role-playing applications, or even character cards?
  - For example:
    - having a medieval fantasy background settings for magic and dragons
    - the only thing we need to do is to focus our writing on our new character when wrap the world settings outside of it
    - perhaps, only when the time goes to night, special prompts will get injected through `if` and `if-else` control flow
  - We can do more things around it...
    - with Vue SFC or React JSX, we can parse the template and identify the props, render a form panel for debugging and testing while writing prompts
    - visualize the entire lorebook and character card in a single interactive page

So why don't we make a tool to write LLM prompts with frontend frameworks like Vue or React, and maybe extend this beyond to other frameworks and platforms?

This is what we got: [**Velin**](https://github.com/luoling8192/velin).

<img class="light" :src="VelinLight" alt="tool to write LLM prompts with Vue.js" />
<img class="dark" :src="VelinDark" alt="tool to write LLM prompts with Vue.js" />

We even made a playground for editing it and render it on-the-fly,
while enjoying the ecosystem of npm packages (yes you can import any!).

<img class="light" :src="VelinPlaygroundLight" alt="tool to write LLM prompts with Vue.js" />
<img class="dark" :src="VelinPlaygroundDark" alt="tool to write LLM prompts with Vue.js" />

Try it here: https://velin-dev.netlify.app

Programmatic API supported too, Markdown (MDX WIP, MDC supported),
you can install it via npm today!

```bash
npm install @velin-dev/core
```

Well... that's all for today, I hope you enjoy reading this DevLog.

Let's end with DevLog with more images from the recent event we attended in Hangzhou, China: The **Demo Day @ Hangzhou**.

<img :src="DemoDayHangzhou1" alt="Demo Day @ Hangzhou" />

This is me, I shared the AIRI project with other attendees, and we had a great time
there! Meet so many of the talented developers, product designers, and entrepreneurs.

Introduced almost everything I shared today in this DevLog, and also the beloved AI VTuber Neuro-sama.

The slides I used to share was this:

<img :src="DemoDayHangzhou2" alt="Demo Day @ Hangzhou" />
